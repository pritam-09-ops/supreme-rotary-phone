Python Notebook Practice

Summary of What I've Learned

In this note book I have gained hands-on experience on using pyton with the help of exercise's ,it contained both  programming fundamentals and  widely used data science libraries. It is my milestone in learning to write reasonable code, parse data, and plot results.



Practiced Core Python Concepts
Function Writing: Designed reusable functions to solve particular problems.
Conditional Logic: Used if/else statements to control different input conditions.
String Manipulation: Used string functions like .split(), .lower(), and .strip().
Loops & Logic : Created concise programs like prime number testers and sequence finders.
User Input : Managed interactive input and output through `input()` and `print()`.

What I Learned About Python Libraries
NumPy
- Proficient in using NumPy for numerical computation and array operations.
- Identified why arrays are superior to Python lists for numeric data.
- Practiced working with arrays, performing vectorized operations, also used  NumPy functions to perform computations.

Pandas
- Employed Pandas to handle data in the tabular structure (DataFrames).
- Gained knowledge on reading CSV files, exploring datasets, and cleaning data.
- Familiarity with working with selecting individual rows/columns, filtering data, and computing summaries (i.e., mean, median, etc.).

Matplotlib
- Used Matplotlib to create visualizations of data.
- Understanding of graphing line graphs, histograms, and bar charts.
- Learned to title axes, add title, and manage visual style.
